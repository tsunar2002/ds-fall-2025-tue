# Homework For Next Week

## NEW: Dashboard Exercise
Create visualizations and dashboards to analyze movie data.

See the detailed instructions in: **[Dashboard_Exercise.md](Dashboard_Exercise.md)**

### Quick Overview:
- **Dataset**: `data/movie_ratings.csv` (MovieLens 100k with user demographics)
- **Goal**: Answer 4 analytical questions using visualizations
- **Tools**: Streamlit (recommended), Jupyter notebooks, or other dashboard tools
- **Questions**:
  1) What's the breakdown of genres for the movies that were rated?
  2) Which genres have the highest viewer satisfaction (highest ratings)? 
  3) How does mean rating change across movie release years?
  4) What are the 5 best-rated movies that have at least 50 ratings? At least 150 ratings?
  5) [EXTRA CREDIT] Pick 4 genres. For each genre, how does the rating change as viewer age increases?
  6) [EXTRA CREDIT] Plot number of ratings vs mean rating per genre. Is there a correlation between the volume of ratings and mean rating?
  7) [EXTRA CREDIT] We gave you a pre-cleaned `genres` column, the original dataset is `movie_ratings_EC.csv`, can you clean it yourself?

This exercise will prepare you for creating professional dashboards and telling stories with data.
