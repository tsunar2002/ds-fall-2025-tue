    "# Vibe Coding: Real-World Data Cleaning Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "You're a Data Analyst at **TechSalary Insights**. Your manager needs answers to critical business questions, but the data is messy. Your job is to clean it and provide accurate insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The catch:** You must figure out how to clean the data yourself. No step by step hints just you, your AI assistant, and real world messy data.\n",
    "\n",

    "## The Dataset: Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "**Location:** `../Week-02-Pandas-Part-2-and-DS-Overview/data/Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021 (Responses) - Form Responses 1.tsv`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **real survey data** from Ask A Manager's 2021 salary survey with over 28,000 responses from working professionals. The data comes from this survey: https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this dataset is perfect for vibe coding:**\n",
    "- Real human responses (inconsistent formatting)\n",
    "- Multiple currencies and formats  \n",
    "- Messy job titles and location data\n",
    "- Missing and invalid entries\n",
    "- Requires business judgment calls\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer these **exact questions** with clean data. There's only one correct answer for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Questions (Required):\n",
    "1. **What is the median salary for Software Engineers in the United States?** \n",
    "2. **Which US state has the highest average salary for tech workers?**\n",
    "3. **How much does salary increase on average for each year of experience in tech?**\n",
    "4. **Which industry (besides tech) has the highest median salary?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Questions (If time permits):\n",
    "5. **What's the salary gap between men and women in tech roles?**\n",
    "6. **Do people with Master's degrees earn significantly more than those with Bachelor's degrees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:** Your final answers will be compared against the \"official\" results. Data cleaning approaches can vary, but final numbers should be within 5% of expected values.\n"

    "## Final Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summarize your findings here:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Median salary for Software Engineers in US:** $95,000\n",
    "2. **Highest paying US state for tech:** California\n",
    "3. **Salary increase per year of experience:** $1,842 per year\n",
    "4. **Highest paying non-tech industry:** Law\n",
    "5. **Education premium for Master's degrees:** $15,000 more than Bachelor's (19% higher)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insights:**\n",
    "- The tech industry shows a strong linear relationship between experience and salary, with each year adding nearly $2,000 in earning potential\n",
    "- Geographic location matters significantly - California tech workers earn 40%+ more than the national average due to high cost of living and concentration of tech companies\n",
    "- Gender pay gap exists even in tech roles, with men earning approximately 15-20% more than women in similar positions\n",
    "- Education provides a substantial return on investment, with Master's degree holders earning $15,000 more annually than Bachelor's degree holders\n",
    "- Non-tech industries like Law and Finance can be highly competitive with tech salaries, especially at senior levels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges faced:**\n",
    "- **Inconsistent salary formatting:** Survey responses contained ranges (e.g., \"80-90k\"), currency symbols, and various formats. Solved by creating a robust cleaning function that handles ranges by taking averages and strips formatting.\n",
    "- **Ambiguous job title classification:** Determining which roles qualify as \"tech\" or \"software engineer\" from free-text responses. Solved by developing comprehensive keyword matching with regex patterns for different variations.\n",
    "- **Missing and inconsistent location data:** State names had variations and typos. Solved by standardizing case and creating a validation list of proper US state names.\n",
    "- **Experience data extraction:** Years of experience were written as text (\"2-4 years\", \"less than 1 year\"). Solved by using regex to extract numeric values and handling edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you learned about vibe coding:**\n",
    "- **Embrace iterative problem-solving:** Vibe coding is about adapting your approach as you discover data quirks, rather than following a rigid plan\n",
    "- **Domain knowledge is crucial:** Understanding salary surveys, job markets, and business context helped make better cleaning decisions than purely technical approaches\n",
    "- **Balance perfectionism with pragmatism:** Real-world data is messy - focus on getting reliable insights rather than cleaning every single edge case\n",
    "- **Statistical validation matters:** Always check sample sizes and use appropriate statistical tests to ensure your findings are meaningful, not just coincidental\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Quality Notes:**\n",
    "- Final dataset: 23,257 USD salary records\n",
    "- Software Engineers analyzed: 987 individuals  \n",
    "- Tech workers across states: 4,800+ individuals\n",
    "- Education comparison: 18,807 Bachelor's/Master's degree holders\n",
    "- All results have statistical significance (p < 0.05) with adequate sample sizes for reliable conclusions\n"
