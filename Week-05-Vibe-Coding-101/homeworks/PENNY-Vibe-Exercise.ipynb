    "\n",
    "## The Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "You're a Data Analyst at **TechSalary Insights**. Your manager needs answers to critical business questions, but the data is messy. Your job is to clean it and provide accurate insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The catch:** You must figure out how to clean the data yourself. No step by step hints just you, your AI assistant, and real world messy data.\n",

    "## The Dataset: Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "**Location:** `../Week-02-Pandas-Part-2-and-DS-Overview/data/Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021 (Responses) - Form Responses 1.tsv`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **real survey data** from Ask A Manager's 2021 salary survey with over 28,000 responses from working professionals. The data comes from this survey: https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this dataset is perfect for vibe coding:**\n",
    "- Real human responses (inconsistent formatting)\n",
    "- Multiple currencies and formats  \n",
    "- Messy job titles and location data\n",
    "- Missing and invalid entries\n",
    "- Requires business judgment calls\n",

    "## Your Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer these **exact questions** with clean data. There's only one correct answer for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Questions (Required):\n",
    "1. **What is the median salary for Software Engineers in the United States?** \n",
    "2. **Which US state has the highest average salary for tech workers?**\n",
    "3. **How much does salary increase on average for each year of experience in tech?**\n",
    "4. **Which industry (besides tech) has the highest median salary?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Questions (If time permits):\n",
    "5. **What's the salary gap between men and women in tech roles?**\n",
    "6. **Do people with Master's degrees earn significantly more than those with Bachelor's degrees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:** Your final answers will be compared against the \"official\" results. Data cleaning approaches can vary, but final numbers should be within 5% of expected values.\n"

    "\n",
    "Based on my analysis of the Ask A Manager Salary Survey dataset, here's my comprehensive data cleaning plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "- **Size**: ~28,000 responses from 2021 salary survey\n",
    "- **Format**: TSV file with 18 columns\n",
    "- **Key Challenges**: Multiple currencies, inconsistent formatting, messy job titles, various country/state formats\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Quality Issues Identified\n",
    "1. **Salary Data**: Multiple currencies (USD, GBP, CAD), inconsistent formatting, potential outliers\n",
    "2. **Location Data**: Inconsistent US state formats (\"US\", \"USA\", \"United States\"), missing states\n",
    "3. **Job Titles**: Highly variable, need to identify \"Software Engineers\" and \"tech workers\"\n",
    "4. **Experience**: Range format (\"5-7 years\", \"8-10 years\") needs conversion to numeric\n",
    "5. **Industry**: Need to categorize tech vs non-tech industries\n",
    "6. **Education/Gender**: For bonus questions, need clean categories\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Cleaning Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Data Exploration & Setup\n",
    "1. Load dataset and examine structure, data types, missing values\n",
    "2. Identify all unique currencies and conversion rates needed\n",
    "3. Map out all unique job titles, industries, and location formats\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Core Data Cleaning\n",
    "1. **Salary Standardization**:\n",
    "   - Convert all salaries to USD using 2021 exchange rates\n",
    "   - Handle missing/zero salaries appropriately\n",
    "   - Remove extreme outliers (likely data entry errors)\n",
    "   - Add bonus compensation to total salary\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Location Standardization**:\n",
    "   - Standardize country names to \"United States\"\n",
    "   - Clean and standardize US state names\n",
    "   - Filter to US-only data for core questions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Job Title Categorization**:\n",
    "   - Create \"Software Engineer\" category (exact matches + variations)\n",
    "   - Create \"Tech Worker\" category (all computing/tech industry roles)\n",
    "   - Handle job title variations and context\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Experience Conversion**:\n",
    "   - Convert experience ranges to midpoint numeric values\n",
    "   - Handle edge cases and missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Analysis Preparation\n",
    "1. **Industry Classification**:\n",
    "   - Identify tech vs non-tech industries\n",
    "   - Standardize industry names\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Education & Gender Cleaning**:\n",
    "   - Standardize education levels for bonus questions\n",
    "   - Clean gender categories\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 4: Business Question Analysis\n",
    "1. **Question 1**: Median salary for Software Engineers in US\n",
    "2. **Question 2**: US state with highest average tech worker salary  \n",
    "3. **Question 3**: Salary increase per year of experience in tech\n",
    "4. **Question 4**: Highest median salary non-tech industry\n",
    "5. **Question 5**: Gender salary gap in tech (bonus)\n",
    "6. **Question 6**: Education level salary comparison (bonus)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Business Decisions\n",
    "- **Currency Conversion**: Use 2021 average exchange rates (GBP‚âà1.37, CAD‚âà0.80)\n",
    "- **Outlier Handling**: Remove salaries <$20k or >$500k as likely errors\n",
    "- **Tech Definition**: \"Computing or Tech\" industry + specific tech job titles\n",
    "- **Experience Mapping**: Use range midpoints (e.g., \"5-7 years\" = 6 years)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Criteria\n",
    "- Final answers within 5% of expected values\n",
    "- Clean, reproducible analysis\n",
    "- Clear documentation of cleaning decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "This plan addresses the real-world messiness of survey data while ensuring we can answer the specific business questions accurately."

    "## Final Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summarize your findings here:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Median salary for Software Engineers in US:** $125,000\n",
    "2. **Highest paying US state for tech:** California\n",
    "3. **Salary increase per year of experience:** $682 per year\n",
    "4. **Remote vs office percentage:** 1.5% remote, 98.2% office\n",
    "5. **Highest paying non-tech industry:** Sales\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus questions**\n",
    "6. **Salary gap between men and women in similar roles**: $15,728\n",
    "7. **Master's degrees earn more than Bachelor's degrees**: 8.3% higher\n",
    "8. **Company size (startup, medium, large) pays the most on average**: Startup/Small\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insights:**\n",
    "- Insight 1: The average salary increase of $682 per year of experience is surprisingly low and linear, suggesting that large salary jumps are less tied to tenure and more to changing companies or obtaining promotions/new roles (which aren't fully captured by the simple regression model). The true value of experience is likely unlocked through mobility rather than long-term loyalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Insight 2: The finding that California is the highest-paying US state for tech, followed by Washington then New York, suggests that high salaries are determined by location and initial cost-of-living adjustments. This highlights that access to the highest baseline compensation requires being geographically anchored in a major tech hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Insight 3: While individuals with Master's degrees earn 8.3% higher median salaries than those with Bachelor's degrees, this difference might not fully justify the cost and time of a graduate degree for some people. The marginal increase suggests that practical experience and job-specific skills often outweigh the pure credential, especially in fast-moving fields like tech, where the salary premium for a Master's degree is less pronounced than in highly regulated fields like medicine or law.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Side Note: The significant gender pay gap requires deeper investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges faced:**\n",
    "- Challenge 1 and how you solved it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Trouble with Cursor: Goal - Connect the local Cursor code editor to a remote GitHub Codespace environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Challenge: The Codespace connection method that relies on the proprietary GitHub Codespaces extension is blocked, and the SSH workaround is failing because the remote environment is not set up correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Solution: Don't connect cursor to codespace, Hussam recommended me to clone the repository locally. \n",
    "    Thank you Hussam! - I learned that it's because codespaces runs on a server and can be accessed on localhost so it's not stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Side Note: Cursor is having trouble validating my ID, so I contacted support and I'm waiting on them to get back to me; for now I'm on the free version.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Challenge 2 and how you solved it: \n",
    "\n",
    "    File Loading and Pathing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Challenge: The initial hurdle was a persistent FileNotFoundError due to the relative path structure (../../Week-02/data/...) in the execution environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Solution: I told Gemini the file I'm currently in which is in the homeworks folder in week 5 as well as the location of the dataset file in the data folder in week 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you learned about vibe coding:**\n",
    "- Learning 1: It's very easy to get lazy and get lost, so it's important to debug and make sure the code works and outputs what you intend it to. Cursor is super helpful and I wish I used it sooner. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning 2: I need to work on my prompt engineering. Specifically - output format, brevity, and inclusion/exclusion of specific details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning 3: Cursor gave me very detailed information and extra information that I didn't ask it to. Basically need to go back and do a TL;DR check and make sure it's actually answering the questions despite it overloading you with data. "
