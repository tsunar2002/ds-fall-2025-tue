    "\n",
    "You're a Data Analyst at **TechSalary Insights**. Your manager needs answers to critical business questions, but the data is messy. Your job is to clean it and provide accurate insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The catch:** You must figure out how to clean the data yourself. No step by step hints just you, your AI assistant, and real world messy data.\n",

    "## The Dataset: Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021\n",

    "\n",
    "This is **real survey data** from Ask A Manager's 2021 salary survey with over 28,000 responses from working professionals. The data comes from this survey: https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this dataset is perfect for vibe coding:**\n",
    "- Real human responses (inconsistent formatting)\n",
    "- Multiple currencies and formats  \n",

    "Answer these **exact questions** with clean data. There's only one correct answer for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Questions (Required):\n",
    "1. **What is the median salary for Software Engineers in the United States?** \n",
    "2. **Which US state has the highest average salary for tech workers?**\n",
    "3. **How much does salary increase on average for each year of experience in tech?**\n",
    "4. **Which industry (besides tech) has the highest median salary?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Questions (If time permits):\n",
    "5. **What's the salary gap between men and women in tech roles?**\n",
    "6. **Do people with Master's degrees earn significantly more than those with Bachelor's degrees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:** Your final answers will be compared against the \"official\" results. Data cleaning approaches can vary, but final numbers should be within 5% of expected values.\n"

    "\n",
    "Based on my analysis of the Ask A Manager Salary Survey dataset, here's my comprehensive data cleaning plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "- **Size**: ~28,000 responses from 2021 salary survey\n",
    "- **Format**: TSV file with 18 columns\n",
    "- **Key Challenges**: Multiple currencies, inconsistent formatting, messy job titles, various country/state formats\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Quality Issues Identified\n",
    "1. **Salary Data**: Multiple currencies (USD, GBP, CAD), inconsistent formatting, potential outliers\n",
    "2. **Location Data**: Inconsistent US state formats (\"US\", \"USA\", \"United States\"), missing states\n",
    "3. **Job Titles**: Highly variable, need to identify \"Software Engineers\" and \"tech workers\"\n",
    "4. **Experience**: Range format (\"5-7 years\", \"8-10 years\") needs conversion to numeric\n",
    "5. **Industry**: Need to categorize tech vs non-tech industries\n",
    "6. **Education/Gender**: For bonus questions, need clean categories\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Cleaning Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Data Exploration & Setup\n",
    "1. Load dataset and examine structure, data types, missing values\n",
    "2. Identify all unique currencies and conversion rates needed\n",
    "3. Map out all unique job titles, industries, and location formats\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Core Data Cleaning\n",
    "1. **Salary Standardization**:\n",
    "   - Convert all salaries to USD using 2021 exchange rates\n",
    "   - Handle missing/zero salaries appropriately\n",
    "   - Remove extreme outliers (likely data entry errors)\n",
    "   - Add bonus compensation to total salary\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Location Standardization**:\n",
    "   - Standardize country names to \"United States\"\n",
    "   - Clean and standardize US state names\n",
    "   - Filter to US-only data for core questions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Job Title Categorization**:\n",
    "   - Create \"Software Engineer\" category (exact matches + variations)\n",
    "   - Create \"Tech Worker\" category (all computing/tech industry roles)\n",
    "   - Handle job title variations and context\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Experience Conversion**:\n",
    "   - Convert experience ranges to midpoint numeric values\n",
    "   - Handle edge cases and missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Analysis Preparation\n",
    "1. **Industry Classification**:\n",
    "   - Identify tech vs non-tech industries\n",
    "   - Standardize industry names\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Education & Gender Cleaning**:\n",
    "   - Standardize education levels for bonus questions\n",
    "   - Clean gender categories\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 4: Business Question Analysis\n",
    "1. **Question 1**: Median salary for Software Engineers in US\n",
    "2. **Question 2**: US state with highest average tech worker salary  \n",
    "3. **Question 3**: Salary increase per year of experience in tech\n",
    "4. **Question 4**: Highest median salary non-tech industry\n",
    "5. **Question 5**: Gender salary gap in tech (bonus)\n",
    "6. **Question 6**: Education level salary comparison (bonus)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Business Decisions\n",
    "- **Currency Conversion**: Use 2021 average exchange rates (GBP≈1.37, CAD≈0.80)\n",
    "- **Outlier Handling**: Remove salaries <$20k or >$500k as likely errors\n",
    "- **Tech Definition**: \"Computing or Tech\" industry + specific tech job titles\n",
    "- **Experience Mapping**: Use range midpoints (e.g., \"5-7 years\" = 6 years)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Criteria\n",
    "- Final answers within 5% of expected values\n",
    "- Clean, reproducible analysis\n",
    "- Clear documentation of cleaning decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "This plan addresses the real-world messiness of survey data while ensuring we can answer the specific business questions accurately."
