    "\n",
    "## The Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "You're a Data Analyst at **TechSalary Insights**. Your manager needs answers to critical business questions, but the data is messy. Your job is to clean it and provide accurate insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The catch:** You must figure out how to clean the data yourself. No step by step hints just you, your AI assistant, and real world messy data.\n",

    "## The Dataset: Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "**Location:** `../Week-02-Pandas-Part-2-and-DS-Overview/data/Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021 (Responses) - Form Responses 1.tsv`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **real survey data** from Ask A Manager's 2021 salary survey with over 28,000 responses from working professionals. The data comes from this survey: https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this dataset is perfect for vibe coding:**\n",
    "- Real human responses (inconsistent formatting)\n",
    "- Multiple currencies and formats  \n",
    "- Messy job titles and location data\n",
    "- Missing and invalid entries\n",
    "- Requires business judgment calls\n",

    "\n",
    "## Your Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer these **exact questions** with clean data. There's only one correct answer for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Questions (Required):\n",
    "1. **What is the median salary for Software Engineers in the United States?** \n",
    "2. **Which US state has the highest average salary for tech workers?**\n",
    "3. **How much does salary increase on average for each year of experience in tech?**\n",
    "4. **Which industry (besides tech) has the highest median salary?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Questions (If time permits):\n",
    "5. **What's the salary gap between men and women in tech roles?**\n",
    "6. **Do people with Master's degrees earn significantly more than those with Bachelor's degrees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:** Your final answers will be compared against the \"official\" results. Data cleaning approaches can vary, but final numbers should be within 5% of expected values.\n"

    "- [ ] Confirm dataset path and load TSV with proper delimiter and encoding\n",
    "- [ ] Inspect schema: columns, dtypes, missingness, sample rows, unique value checks\n",
    "- [ ] Standardize column names to snake_case and trim whitespace\n",
    "- [ ] Clean salary fields: parse numeric, handle ranges, strip symbols, convert all to USD\n",
    "- [ ] Handle currencies: detect currency column/patterns, map FX rates, convert consistently\n",
    "- [ ] Filter invalid/irrelevant rows (e.g., missing salary, non-employed, internships if out of scope)\n",
    "- [ ] Remove exact duplicates and near-duplicates if any\n",
    "- [ ] Winsorize or cap extreme salary outliers with transparent rule; keep raw copy\n",
    "- [ ] Normalize job titles; create flag for tech roles and a `Software Engineer` canonical label\n",
    "- [ ] Parse/normalize location: extract country, US state codes; map free-text to standard\n",
    "- [ ] Parse years of experience; coerce text ranges to numeric (midpoint) and handle 0/NaN\n",
    "- [ ] Normalize education levels to ordered categories (HS, Assoc, BA/BS, MS/MA, PhD)\n",
    "- [ ] Standardize gender categories (male, female, nonbinary/other, prefer_not_say)\n",
    "- [ ] Create a clean, analysis-ready dataframe `df_clean` with documented transformations\n",
    "- [ ] Validate with spot checks: distribution of salaries, counts by country/state/role\n",
    "- [ ] Q1: Compute median salary for `Software Engineer` in United States\n",
    "- [ ] Q2: Compute average salary by US state for tech workers; identify max\n",
    "- [ ] Q3: Fit simple model/regression or groupwise slope: salary increase per YoE in tech\n",
    "- [ ] Q4: Identify highest median salary industry excluding tech\n",
    "- [ ] Bonus: Gender pay gap in tech roles (controlled/uncontrolled)\n",
    "- [ ] Bonus: Compare MS vs BA median salaries; significance test if feasible\n",
    "- [ ] Create clear tables/plots supporting each answer\n",
    "- [ ] Document assumptions and cleaning rules inline (markdown) next to code\n",
    "- [ ] Summarize final answers; ensure results within Â±5% of expected benchmarks\n",
    "- [ ] Save cleaned dataset and key aggregates to CSV for reproducibility\n"
