    "## The Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "You're a Data Analyst at **TechSalary Insights**. Your manager needs answers to critical business questions, but the data is messy. Your job is to clean it and provide accurate insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The catch:** You must figure out how to clean the data yourself. No step by step hints just you, your AI assistant, and real world messy data.\n",

    "## The Dataset: Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021\n",

    "**Location:** `../Week-02-Pandas-Part-2-and-DS-Overview/data/Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021 (Responses) - Form Responses 1.tsv`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **real survey data** from Ask A Manager's 2021 salary survey with over 28,000 responses from working professionals. The data comes from this survey: https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this dataset is perfect for vibe coding:**\n",
    "- Real human responses (inconsistent formatting)\n",
    "- Multiple currencies and formats  \n",
    "- Messy job titles and location data\n",
    "- Missing and invalid entries\n",
    "- Requires business judgment calls\n",

    "## Your Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer these **exact questions** with clean data. There's only one correct answer for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Questions (Required):\n",
    "1. **What is the median salary for Software Engineers in the United States?** \n",
    "2. **Which US state has the highest average salary for tech workers?**\n",
    "3. **How much does salary increase on average for each year of experience in tech?**\n",
    "4. **Which industry (besides tech) has the highest median salary?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Questions (If time permits):\n",
    "5. **What's the salary gap between men and women in tech roles?**\n",
    "6. **Do people with Master's degrees earn significantly more than those with Bachelor's degrees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:** Your final answers will be compared against the \"official\" results. Data cleaning approaches can vary, but final numbers should be within 5% of expected values.\n"
