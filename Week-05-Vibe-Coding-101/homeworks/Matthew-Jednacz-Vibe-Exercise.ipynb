    "# Vibe Coding: Real-World Data Cleaning Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "You're a Data Analyst at **TechSalary Insights**. Your manager needs answers to critical business questions, but the data is messy. Your job is to clean it and provide accurate insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The catch:** You must figure out how to clean the data yourself. No step by step hints just you, your AI assistant, and real world messy data.\n",

    "## The Dataset: Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "**Location:** `../Week-02-Pandas-Part-2-and-DS-Overview/data/Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021 (Responses) - Form Responses 1.tsv`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **real survey data** from Ask A Manager's 2021 salary survey with over 28,000 responses from working professionals. The data comes from this survey: https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this dataset is perfect for vibe coding:**\n",
    "- Real human responses (inconsistent formatting)\n",
    "- Multiple currencies and formats  \n",
    "- Messy job titles and location data\n",
    "- Missing and invalid entries\n",
    "- Requires business judgment calls\n",

    "\n",
    "## Your Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer these **exact questions** with clean data. There's only one correct answer for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Questions (Required):\n",
    "1. **What is the median salary for Software Engineers in the United States?** \n",
    "2. **Which US state has the highest average salary for tech workers?**\n",
    "3. **How much does salary increase on average for each year of experience in tech?**\n",
    "4. **Which industry (besides tech) has the highest median salary?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Questions (If time permits):\n",
    "5. **What's the salary gap between men and women in tech roles?**\n",
    "6. **Do people with Master's degrees earn significantly more than those with Bachelor's degrees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:** Your final answers will be compared against the \"official\" results. Data cleaning approaches can vary, but final numbers should be within 5% of expected values.\n"

    "Data Loading & Exploration Phase\n",
    "[ ] Load and explore the TSV dataset - examine structure, columns, data types, missing values, and basic statistics\n",
    "[ ] Identify key data quality issues - inconsistent salary formats, multiple currencies, messy job titles, location inconsistencies, experience format variations\n",
    "Data Cleaning Phase\n",
    "[ ] Clean salary data - handle different currencies, remove non-numeric characters, convert to USD using appropriate exchange rates, handle missing values\n",
    "[ ] Standardize job titles - create categories for tech roles, identify software engineers specifically, handle variations in job title formatting\n",
    "[ ] Clean location data - standardize country names (US, USA, United States), validate and standardize state names, handle missing location data\n",
    "[ ] Clean experience data - convert range formats to numeric values, handle missing experience data, create consistent experience categories\n",
    "[ ] Clean demographic data - standardize gender categories, education levels, and race categories for analysis\n",
    "[ ] Create analysis columns - derived columns for analysis (tech worker flag, remote work indicator, company size categories, industry groupings)\n",
    "Data Validation Phase\n",
    "[ ] Validate cleaned data - check for outliers, verify salary ranges are reasonable, ensure data consistency across key fields\n",
    "Business Questions Analysis Phase\n",
    "[ ] Answer Question 1 - Calculate median salary for Software Engineers in the United States\n",
    "[ ] Answer Question 2 - Determine which US state has the highest average salary for tech workers\n",
    "[ ] Answer Question 3 - Calculate average salary increase per year of experience in tech\n",
    "[ ] Answer Question 4 - Identify which industry (besides tech) has the highest median salary\n",
    "[ ] Answer bonus questions - gender salary gap in tech, education impact on salary, company size salary analysis\n",
    "Final Documentation Phase\n",
    "[ ] Create final summary - key findings, insights, challenges faced, and lessons learned about data cleaning\n",
    "Key Challenges Expected:\n",
    "Multiple currencies - Need to convert GBP, EUR, CAD, etc. to USD\n",
    "Inconsistent salary formats - Comma separators, ranges, hourly vs annual\n",
    "Messy job titles - \"Software Engineer\" vs \"SWE\" vs \"Developer\" variations\n",
    "Location standardization - \"US\" vs \"USA\" vs \"United States\"\n",
    "Experience ranges - \"5-7 years\" needs to be converted to numeric values\n",
    "Missing data handling - Strategic decisions on imputation vs exclusion\n",
    "This plan follows a logical progression from exploration → cleaning → validation → analysis → documentation, which is the standard approach for real-world data science projects.\n"
