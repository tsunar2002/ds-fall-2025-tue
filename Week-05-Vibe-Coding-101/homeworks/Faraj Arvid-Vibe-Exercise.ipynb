    "## The Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "You're a Data Analyst at **TechSalary Insights**. Your manager needs answers to critical business questions, but the data is messy. Your job is to clean it and provide accurate insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The catch:** You must figure out how to clean the data yourself. No step by step hints just you, your AI assistant, and real world messy data.\n",

    "## The Dataset: Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021\n",

    "**Location:** `../Week-02-Pandas-Part-2-and-DS-Overview/data/Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021 (Responses) - Form Responses 1.tsv`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **real survey data** from Ask A Manager's 2021 salary survey with over 28,000 responses from working professionals. The data comes from this survey: https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this dataset is perfect for vibe coding:**\n",

    "### Core Questions (Required):\n",
    "1. **What is the median salary for Software Engineers in the United States?** \n",
    "2. **Which US state has the highest average salary for tech workers?**\n",
    "3. **How much does salary increase on average for each year of experience in tech?**\n",
    "4. **Which industry (besides tech) has the highest median salary?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Questions (If time permits):\n",
    "5. **What's the salary gap between men and women in tech roles?**\n",
    "6. **Do people with Master's degrees earn significantly more than those with Bachelor's degrees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:** Your final answers will be compared against the \"official\" results. Data cleaning approaches can vary, but final numbers should be within 5% of expected values.\n"

    "- [ ] Confirm scope and decisions\n",
    "  - **Authoritative questions**: Use the top “Core Questions” list. Clarify if the later “remote vs office” is required.\n",
    "  - **Dataset path**: Point to local TSV; confirm encoding and separator.\n",
    "  - **Currency**: Convert all to USD using a fixed rate table (if needed) or restrict to USD-only rows.\n",
    "  - **Annualization**: Treat values as annualized (per survey prompt). Exclude rows with non-annual or unclear entries.\n",
    "  - **Tech roles**: Define “tech” via `What industry do you work in?` contains “Computing or Tech” OR job title keyword list.\n",
    "  - **Software Engineer definition**: Job title contains keywords: software engineer, SWE, SDE, developer, backend, frontend, full stack, etc. Exclude “manager” unless explicitly included.\n",
    "  - **Experience column**: Use `How many years of professional work experience do you have overall?` Map ranges to midpoints.\n",
    "  - **Geography**: Use `What country do you work in?` for U.S. filter; for states, use `If you're in the U.S., what state do you work in?`.\n",
    "  - **Outliers**: Remove extreme salaries (e.g., < $10k or > $1M), drop missing salary/currency, enforce positive numeric.\n",
    "  - **Full-time**: If context indicates part-time/contract, exclude unless clearly annualized.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Load and sanity-check\n",
    "  - Read TSV with `sep=\"\\t\"`, try `encoding=\"utf-8\"`, fallback to `latin-1` if needed.\n",
    "  - Verify row/column counts, preview `head()`, check unique currencies, countries, industries, and null rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Profile schema and quality\n",
    "  - Identify key columns: salary, additional comp, currency, country, state, job title, industry, experience, gender, education.\n",
    "  - Compute missingness, unique counts, and distributions for salary/experience.\n",
    "  - Detect currency mix and presence of non-numeric salary strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Normalize fields\n",
    "  - **Salary**: Strip commas/whitespace; coerce to numeric. Create `total_comp = salary + additional_comp` where valid.\n",
    "  - **Currency**:\n",
    "    - Option A: Convert to USD using a fixed 2021 mapping (USD=1, GBP≈1.38, EUR≈1.20; confirm table).\n",
    "    - Option B: Restrict to `currency == USD` for core answers; document exclusion.\n",
    "  - **Experience**: Map ranges to midpoint (e.g., “2 - 4 years” → 3).\n",
    "  - **Geography**: Normalize country (`US`, `USA` → `United States`). Standardize state names/abbreviations.\n",
    "  - **Titles/Industries**: Lowercase, trim, collapse whitespace. Build keyword sets for tech roles and software engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Apply filters by question\n",
    "  - U.S.-only when required (Q1, Q2).\n",
    "  - Tech roles for Q2, Q3; software engineer subset for Q1.\n",
    "  - Exclude rows failing numeric/clean checks or missing critical fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Compute core questions\n",
    "  - Q1 (Median salary for Software Engineers in U.S.): median USD `total_comp` (or base salary if required) on software engineer subset in `United States`.\n",
    "  - Q2 (Highest average salary by U.S. state for tech workers): group tech subset by state; mean USD `total_comp`; return top state.\n",
    "  - Q3 (Average increase per year of experience in tech): linear regression of USD `total_comp` on experience years in tech subset; report slope ($/year). Sanity-check with binned means.\n",
    "  - Q4 (Highest median salary by industry excluding tech): group by industry, exclude tech; median USD `total_comp`; return top industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Validation and sensitivity\n",
    "  - Re-run results with/without additional comp; note differences.\n",
    "  - Trim top/bottom 1% and confirm stability.\n",
    "  - Ensure results within 5% tolerance of expected benchmarks (if given); document assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Documentation and deliverables\n",
    "  - Paste this plan at top of notebook.\n",
    "  - Record final numeric answers and short rationale.\n",
    "  - List key cleaning decisions: currency approach, filters, outlier rules.\n",
    "  - Note limitations and potential impact.\n",

    "- [ ] Ready-to-implement checklist\n",
    "  - [ ] Confirm currency approach (convert vs USD-only)\n",
    "  - [ ] Finalize tech/software engineer keyword lists\n",
    "  - [ ] Confirm whether to include additional comp in “salary”\n",
    "  - [ ] Confirm whether “remote vs office” question is required"

    "## Final Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summarize your findings here:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Median salary for Software Engineers in US:** $135,600\n",
    "2. **Highest paying US state for tech:** California\n",
    "3. **Salary increase per year of experience:** $2,050 per year\n",
    "4. **Remote vs office percentage:** Work modality is not widely collected in the dataset. So this question cannot be answered with the available data.\n",
    "5. **Highest paying non-tech industry:** Law\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insights:**\n",
    "- The major tech hubs in America on the East (NYC + Boston) and West (California + Washington) coasts pay the best. This is expected as decades of technological innovation have taken place in these cities. This innovation has made the cities popular areas for people to move to, but the high cost of living requires bigger salaires to support yourself.\n",
    "- Kids are often told STEM oriented careers are the most lucrative but after tech, 5 of the highest paying non-tech industries are business related. Sales, Accounting, and Business are 5 of the best paying industries that do not include tech. Law is also another non STEM related career path on the list and actually tops the list as the best paying industry outside of tech. Engineering is actually the only STEM centered industry present on the top 5 which goes to show the advice kids get is misleading.\n",
    "- There will be times when certain business questions cannot be answered by your data. A great example is question 4 in this assignment. There is not really any information collected in the dataset pertaining to work modality so the question really cannot be answered at all. This means that the business questions asked of the data need to fall within the context of data avaliable in the dataset or we need to enrich our data with more information in order to answer the business questions asked that fall outside of the scope of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges faced:**\n",
    "- I had a lot of trouble with uploading the dataset to Cursor. I am not sure if it was because of the file type or because I used the free version but I could not just upload it normally like I did with my .ipynb file. Eventually I solved it by downloading the dataset locally and opening it on Cursor and then copying + pasting the results from the Agent to my CodeSpace to complete this assignment.\n",
    "- Question 4 was confusing because Cursor told me there was no work modality data collected in the dataset. At first I thought it was a hallucination until I went and checked the file myself and saw how there was no column for work location. Cursor further expanded on this by creating a script that showed me 99% of the jobs in the data had no work modality included. This cleared things up a lot and let me answer the question properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you learned about vibe coding:**\n",
    "- Sometimes AI overcomplicate things. I remember for our data cleaning HW earlier, the code was not nearly as complex and long as the code genereated by my AI Agent for this assignment.\n",
    "- Breaking things up helps both the AI and me. I found that splitting up the code and steps allowed me to better track the AI's changes and not feel as overwhelmed or lost in my own code file.\n",
    "- Double checking is necessary. There were times where Cursor said it arrived at a solution for a problem without even providing a answer (1 state is asked for but Cursor provides a list of 10)."
